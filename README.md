Project Name - ExpendiShare

# Project Description -
This website will help you manage your expenses between friends. So, you don't need to worry about it while you are on vacation or small outing.

The inspiration for the project comes because as a student living in the hostel we have to manage the money wisely. And we tend to forget the small expenses between friends so we have to maintain a ledger for it. And then we found the Splitwise app on the PlayStore. So, we were curious how this app actually works so we try to make it.
